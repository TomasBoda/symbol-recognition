# Handwritten Symbol Recognition Using Matrix Distances
by [Tomáš Boďa](https://github.com/TomasBoda)

## About
The aim of this project was to create a simple GUI tool which is able to distinguish between different handwritten symbols based on the probability of coincidence, which is calculated as a matrix distance between the trained symbols and the symbol that is being recognized.

## Technical details
The project is written entirely in Java, with no external packages or librariess being used.
